                    Studies have shown that body languages convey much more information than words, so be cautious — when you are saying how good you are, your body may betray you, and the interviewer will most likely believe what your body says. According to a highly recognized
                    communication study by Mehrabian, body languages accounts for 55% of the overall message. They significantly affect how interviewers perceive you starting from the moment you walk into the interview room, so knowing the differences
                    between poor and effective body languages and practicing the effective ones are important preparation to get your dream job. Before we get to the sweet stuff, look at the video and notice the differences on you own.
